**Class:** `com.android.apksig.internal.asn1.Asn1DecodingException`

| Section | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Main purpose / role** | This class is a *checked exception* that signals failure to decode an ASN.1 structure. It extends `java.lang.Exception`, so callers are required (or at least advised) to handle or propagate the error. The constructor overloads allow a human‑readable message and an optional underlying cause (`Throwable`). |
| **Importance in the application** | **Core / foundational**. The Android APK signing library (`com.android.apksig`) relies on ASN.1 parsing to interpret X.509 certificates, signature blocks, and various protocol messages. Whenever the library encounters malformed or unexpected ASN.1 data, it throws this exception. Because many other classes reference it (`ApkSigningBlockUtils`, `V1SchemeVerifier`, `X509CertificateUtils`, etc.), it is a central part of error handling throughout the signing/verification subsystem. |
| **Context and use case** | 1. **Certificate handling** – When reading an X.509 certificate from an APK, the certificate’s ASN.1 DER encoding is parsed. If parsing fails, an `Asn1DecodingException` bubbles up. 2. **Signature block parsing** – APK signing blocks (V2/V3 schemes) contain ASN.1‑encoded data; the utilities that extract and validate these blocks catch this exception to signal corruption. 3. **General ASN.1 utilities** – Any helper that decodes generic ASN.1 structures may throw this to signal that the byte stream does not conform to expected tags, lengths, or structure. 4. **Error propagation** – The exception is used to surface low‑level decoding errors to higher‑level callers (e.g., the public `ApkVerifier` API) so that they can report “invalid signature” or “corrupted APK” messages to the user. 5. **Testing / robustness** – By throwing a distinct exception type, unit tests can specifically assert that malformed inputs trigger the expected failure path. |

In short, `Asn1DecodingException` is the canonical error type for all ASN.1 parsing problems within the APK signing library. It is a core class that enables consistent error handling across certificate parsing, signature block validation, and other low‑level ASN.1 operations.
