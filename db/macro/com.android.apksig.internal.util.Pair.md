**Class:** `com.android.apksig.internal.util.Pair<A, B>`  

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **Main purpose / role** | A lightweight, immutable container for two heterogeneous values (`first` and `second`).  It functions the same way as the classic “tuple” pattern – the class holds a pair of objects, exposes them via `getFirst()` and `getSecond()`, and implements value‑based `equals()`/`hashCode()` for safe use in collections. |
| **Importance in the application** | **Supporting/utility** – the class is not part of the core business logic (i.e., it doesn’t implement signing or verification itself), but it is **essential** for many other components to return two related results without creating custom holder classes.  Because it’s referenced by a large number of APK‑signing classes (v1/v2/v3/v4 scheme signers, verifiers, stamp utilities, etc.), it is a core *helper* that keeps the codebase tidy and type‑safe. |
| **Context and use case** | In the APK signing framework, several operations naturally produce two correlated pieces of data.  Typical scenarios include:  <br><br>1. **Returning an algorithm identifier together with its parsed representation** – e.g., a method that reads a byte‑array from an APK signing block may return `Pair<AlgorithmIdentifier, byte[]>`.  <br>2. **Providing a key and its associated certificate chain** – e.g., a signer factory that builds a signing key pair and the chain it belongs to may return `Pair<PrivateKey, List<X509Certificate>>`.  <br>3. **Mapping a digest algorithm to its output length** – useful for V2/V3 stamping logic.  <br><br>Because the `Pair` is immutable and has `equals()/hashCode()`, these returned values can safely be cached or used as map keys.  The static `of()` factory method keeps construction concise (e.g., `Pair.of(a, b)`).  <br><br>Overall, the class acts as a *generic “return‑value” carrier* that simplifies method signatures across the signing, verification, and stamping sub‑packages, allowing each component to remain focused on its primary responsibility while delegating the packaging of auxiliary data to this small, well‑tested utility.
